    # features. For +:marking+, an array of places (or Marking features) is
    # expected. For +:firing+ and +:flux+, an array of transitions (or Firing
    # / Flux features) is expected. For +:gradient+ and +:delta+, a hash value
    # is expected, containing keys +:places+ and +:transitions+, specifying
    # for which place set / transition set should gradient / delta features
    # be constructed. More in detail, values supplied under keys +:marking+,
    # +:firing+, +:gradient+, +:flux+ and +:delta+ are delegated to
    # +Features.marking+, +Features.firing+, +Features.gradient+ and
    # +Features.flux+ methods, and their results are joined into a single
    # feature set.
