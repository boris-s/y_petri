# This class represents a simulator.
# 
class YPetri::Core
  # TODO: currently, Core and Simulation classes are tightly coupled.
  # each simulation has just one core, and that core looks directly
  # into the simulation's state. What needs to be done is a simulation
  # that at least hints the process of core recruitment for the requested
  # operation (be it step, step backwards, run forward aso.) and then
  # imprints the core with its current marking vector, tells the core
  # what to do, and then reads the result and updates its marking vector
  # accordingly. There are multiple possibilities, such as constructing
  # a new core for each operation, or keeping the same core for all the
  # operations using a given method. A simulation method (like euler,
  # gillespie, or runge-kutta) should be associated not so much with
  # the simulation object, as it should be associated with the core
  # object. A core object should be more or less one-trick pony. While
  # later, it is possible for a simulation to have broader simulation
  # strategy, or "method" in the broader sense. But simulation should
  # also avoid doing too much, because above it, there is Agent class,
  # and this class can be taught to do the more complicated things
  # such as parameter optimization or computation of control coefficients
  # and such. It is also possible to construct more specialized agent-like
  # classes for these more specialized tasks, since the main purpose
  # of Agent class, as I saw it, was to represent the user (represent
  # what the user means), to provide the user interface.
