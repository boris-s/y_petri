# TODO: Decouple Core and Simulation classes. It still looks like one
# simulation will use only one core (or one for each type of simulation
# trick), but I don't want the core to be parametrized by a Simulation
# instance. There should be at least a hint of core recruitment, sending
# the state to the core, asking the core to perform its trick on it, and
# asking back the results (or rigging the core to send them back as soon
# as done). A core should be more or less a one-trick pony. But simulation
# should also avoid doing too much, because above it, other classes (Agent
# and co.) may exist, doing things like optimization, parameter inferences
# aso.

# TODO: Regarding guarded cores, many kinds of PNs prohibit places from
# acquiring negative marking, or impose other restrictions. If the system
# state somehow makes it out of this safe envelope, the transitions may
# start behaving unpredictably. So there is a question of who is responsible
# for keeping the system sane (in the safe state envelope). The simple thing
# is for the core not to test anything and leave it up to the user not to
# define systems that are not sane. Simple is good, but there must be agreement,
# a requirement that the system specification behaves. If there is no such
# agreement, the core has no excuse from the need to guard against transitions
# trying to fire when they should properly be disabled (at least not if the
# core knows that the PN in question is classical). I did not decide what exactly
# should happen if the sanity is broken (raise an error? warn and try minor
# repair measures yourself?), but something should.
#
# Another example, in chemical systems, negative markings (concentrations)
# also ordinarily make no sense. But insensitive combination of functions
# and simulation method may lead to unsafe state with relatively late detection
# of error, leaving the modeller wondering when exactly the system state went
# haywire. Again, I'm not sure how exactly should the guarded core react to
# the treat of insane situation, but it somehow should.
#
# I feel it is necessary for the core to have awareness of the quality of
# the momentary system's state (at least to be able to tell whether it's
# meaningful at all), because later I want to let the core choose between
# deterministic (continous) and stochastic (discrete, going quantum by
# quantum, or by several quanta, there is more than one stochastic discrete
# method in stock) methods for simulation of individual processes.
