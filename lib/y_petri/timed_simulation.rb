# Speaking about the simulation method, in general, each element of a net
# can, in general, be simulated using a different method. From the pragmatic
# point of view, however, many good simulation methods have been developed
# for the ordinary differential equations of the form:
#
# (1) State(t) = Integral ( f(state, t), dt ), where f(state, t) is known
# function. Now, it's better to know its Jacobian, too, but not necessary -
# can be computed)
#
# #FIXME: Look up proper notation in Advanced Engineering Mathematics
#
# Now, many of these methods depend on Jacobian, but that cannot be computed
# for all of the places. Therefore, the places, whose marking defines the
# system state, are divided into two categories: "A" (accelerated) places,
# for which as a group Jacobian can be found, and "E" places, where "E" can
# stand either for "External" or "Euler".
#
# While Simulation class is not a chemical factor in any sense, the
# definition of "causal orientation" of border transition can be applied to
# it. Then, it can be said that among border transitions between "A" and "E"
# places, only the transitions causally oriented towards "A" places are
# allowed for compliance with the equation (1).
#
# Clamping is a problem of its own.
