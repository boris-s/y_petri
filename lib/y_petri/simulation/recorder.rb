    # TODO: Method #get_features( features )  seems to be just a little bit
    # roundabout way of doing things, but not much more so than #send method,
    # so it's still somehow OK. The question is, who should know what the
    # features are and how they are extracted from various objects. Features?
    # Or those objects?
    #
    # Ruby already has one mechanism of features, which are called properties
    # of objects, and are presented by selector methods. Features reified as
    # first-class objects are themselves responsible for their functional
    # definitions. Features as first-class objects are related to Ted Nelson's
    # ZZ dimensions. Current "Features" will have to be somehow merged (or
    # at least, it will be necessary to consider their merger) with the ZZ
    # structures once YNelson is finished to the point to which it should be
    # finished.
    #
    # It seems to me that there is no use to decide in advance and in general
    # who should hold the functional definition of every feature and every
    # object. Sometimes it is convenient if the objects help to compute their
    # common features (akin to patients being able to tell the doctor their
    # name and family history), while in other cases, the features themselves
    # should define the procedures needed to extract the values from the
    # objects (akin to the doctor examining the patient).
