# YPetri is a domain model and a domain-specific language (DSL) for modelling of
# dynamical systems. YPetri module contains a collection of assets for Petri
# net-based model specification and its simulation.
#
# A Petri net (PN) is a bipartite graph with two kinds of nodes: places and
# transitions. Places are visualised as circles, transitions as rectangles. Arcs
# connecting places and transitions are visualised as lines, but these are not
# considered first class citizens in YPetri abstraction.
#
# During PN execution (simulation), transitions act upon places and change their
# marking by adding / removing tokens as dictated by the prescription of their
# operation. This can be done by attaching a function to the transition. Such
# transitions are called functional transitions in YPetri. Borrowing more from
# the functional terminology, YPetri defines keywords domain an codomain for
# a PN transition in a way similar to the domain and codomain of a function.
#
# YPetri unifies discrete and stochastic modelling of timed transitions at the
# level of model specification in line with the present day unifying Petri net
# frameworks. YPetri also integrates other dichotomies: timed / timeless and
# stoichiometric / nonstoichiometric.
