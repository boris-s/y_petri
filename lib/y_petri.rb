# YPetri represents Petri net (PN) formalims.
#
# A PN consists of places and transitions. There are also arcs, "arrows"
# connecting places and transitions, but these are not considered first class
# citizens in YPetri.
#
# During PN execution (simulation), transitions act upon places and change their
# marking by adding / removing tokens as dictated by their function -- more
# precisely, their operation prescription. Borrowing more from the functional
# terminology, I define domain an codomain of a PN transition in a similar way
# to the functional domain and codomain.
#
# Hybrid Functional Petri Net (HFPN) formalism, motivated by the needs of
# modeling of cellular processes, explicitly introduces the option of having
# discrete as well as continuous places and transitions (therefrom "hybrid").
# In YPetri, the emphasis is elsewhere. Just like in modern computer languages,
# there is a fluid transition between Fixnum and Bignum, YPetri attempts for
# similarly fluid transition between Integer (ie. discrete) and floating point
# (ie. continuous) representation of token amounts and reaction speeds. Whole
# discrete / continuous issue thus becomes the business of the simulator, not
# the model.
