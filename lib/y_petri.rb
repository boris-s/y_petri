# YPetri represents Petri net (PN) formalism.
#
# A PN consists of places and transitions. There are also arcs, that is,
# "arrows" connecting places and transitions, though arcs are not considered
# first class citizens in YPetri.
#
# At the time of PN execution (or simulation), transitions act upon places
# and change their marking by placing or removing tokens as dictated by
# their operation method ("function").
#
# Hybrid Functional Petri Net formalism, motivated by modeling cellular
# processes by their authors' Cell Illustrator software, explicitly
# introduces the possibility of both discrete and continuous places and
# transitions ('Hybrid'). YPetri does not emphasize this. Just like there is
# fluid transition between Fixnum and Bignum, there should be fluid
# transition between token amount representation as Integer (discrete) or
# Float (continuous) - the decision should be on the simulator.
